A Personalized 3D Printed Prosthetic Limb
Objective: To create affordable prosthetic limbs that amputees are happy with
Background: Given to amputee children, teenagers, and adults in the United States
Methodology: Using SolidWorks, a 3D printer, and the amputee's medical data to make the prosthetic limb a custom fit
Expected results: An aesthetically pleasing prothetic limb that amputees are proud to show off so that people can see them with admiration instead of pity
Costs: Unsure of the exact cost, but will be cheaper than the high-tech prosthetic limbs being created now
